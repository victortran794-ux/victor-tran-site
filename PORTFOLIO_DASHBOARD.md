# Portfolio Dashboard

Last updated: 2026-06-06

This is the quick cockpit for portfolio work: what exists, what state it is in, and what to do next.

## Authority note

This file is authoritative for current portfolio status, the active plan, project tracker state, and next actions. It is not authoritative for the master repo operating manual, agent handoff rules, creative direction, or design token values.

Consult next:

- `PORTFOLIO_SYSTEM.md` for repo structure, publishing, health checks, and maintenance rules.
- `PORTFOLIO_AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md` for agent roles, permissions, guardrails, handoffs, and closeout.
- `PORTFOLIO_DIRECTION_BRIEF.md` for creative/product direction and enhancement intent.
- `content/design-system.md` and `content/design-system.json` for design system principles and tokens.
- `archive/planning/README.md` for historical planning context only.

## Active plan

### Current active plan

Use the adjusted slice structure below to decide what kind of work comes next. Start with current-site review, then choose one focused branch from the public tone, public visual/interaction, or protected Document Processing tracks. Keep future concepts parked unless Victor explicitly selects one.

### Current next actions

1. Run a current-site review pass across desktop/mobile and Light/Dark.
2. Convert review notes into a short prioritized punch list, not an immediate implementation batch.
3. Choose one adjusted slice for the next branch: public tone/voice cleanup, public visual/interaction polish, or Document Processing protected-page media/story review.
4. Keep A2UI, broader visual expansion, new portfolio concept systems, and bigger motion/prototype ideas parked unless Victor explicitly selects one.
5. Do not start protected-page promotion, sitemap changes, major copy rewrites, or broad redesign work without explicit approval.

### Supporting historical context

- Latest reset checkpoint: `archive/planning/portfolio-enhancement-state-2026-06-06.md`.
- Historical planning files under `archive/planning/` are context only unless this dashboard or `PORTFOLIO_DIRECTION_BRIEF.md` explicitly references them as active work.
- Legacy status snapshot: `archive/planning/portfolio-status-legacy-2026-05-18.md`; do not use it as the current status tracker.

## Current enhancement phase

Status: clean reset after public-site polish, Document Processing placeholder media, homepage/About wording polish, and Git branch cleanup; broad expansion remains paused pending review.

Recent shipped work:

- Phase C color punctuation examples are live on IBM Cloud, Ability Experience, and SAL Magazine.
- Homepage sequence system is live: tracklist intro, now-playing chip, non-sticky chapter-progress behavior, and the wide-desktop marquee gap fix.
- Navigation has been simplified: the separate top-level Galleries menu is gone, and `Art & Illustration` plus `Graphics` now live under Work.
- The homepage Work area now separates primary project cards from a dedicated Galleries subsection; the Gallery cards use one image each, orange/purple text surfaces, and the tighter `Visual archive` framing.
- Recent public-site polish also shipped: homepage Work-section copy refinement, About photo accessibility, public-page accessibility/performance hygiene, and a real Pause/Play control for the Art & Illustration slideshow.
- Follow-up cleanup shipped: public image dimensions were added, decorative em-dash rhythm was removed from selected public copy/captions, and generated content exports were regenerated.
- Document Processing placeholder media shipped in PR #63: four curated temporary visuals were added to the protected/noindex case study while preserving password gate, sitemap omission, and current navigation visibility.
- Homepage/About wording polish shipped in PR #64: the selected-work intro, Ability Experience homepage card, and one IBM bio sentence were tightened without visual, navigation, sitemap, protected-page, or asset changes.
- About page remains otherwise unchanged after the reverted program-note experiment.
- A2UI is paused as a future track; no `a2ui.html` page or public promotion yet.

Current next action:

- Use `archive/planning/portfolio-enhancement-state-2026-06-06.md` as the current reset checkpoint.
- Use the adjusted enhancement slices below so review, copy, visual/UI polish, protected-page work, and future concepts do not get mixed together.
- Do current-site review first, then choose one focused slice for the next branch.
- Keep the tone/wording review active for future passes: flag pull quotes, section headers, labels, captions, metadata, and supporting copy that feel too cheesy, over-written, theatrical, or agent-written.
- Treat Document Processing as a live protected project package with temporary placeholder media now merged. If selected later, review placeholder fit and use the private media-audit handoff as source material before changing visuals or claims: `C:\Users\Victor\Documents\Website Items\Portfolio Handoffs\Document Processing\document-processing-claude-code-figma-media-audit-consolidated-2026-06-02.md`.
- Keep broad visual expansion and A2UI paused until Victor explicitly selects one of those future tracks.

## Adjusted enhancement slices

### A. Current-site review and punch list

Purpose: review what is already live and decide what actually needs attention before creating another branch.

Includes:

- Homepage Work/Galleries framing and whether `Visual archive` feels like supporting material.
- Ability Experience card copy.
- About wording and image behavior.
- Art & Illustration slideshow Pause/Play control.
- Desktop/mobile and Light/Dark checks.
- Tone issues that feel too polished, cheesy, theatrical, or agent-written.

Output: a short prioritized punch list. No implementation unless Victor approves a specific item.

### B. Public copy/tone slice

Purpose: make the public site sound more like Victor and less agent-polished.

Includes:

- Homepage card copy.
- Gallery labels and captions.
- About copy.
- Pull quotes and section headers.
- Dash-heavy or overly clever sentence rhythm.

Excludes layout redesign, new visuals, and protected pages unless Victor explicitly selects them.

### C. Public visual/interaction polish slice

Purpose: make small public-page UI improvements without starting a new design-system rollout.

Includes:

- Art & Illustration Pause/Play button treatment.
- Homepage Work/Galleries visual balance.
- Media loading and image behavior.
- Small responsive tweaks.

Excludes new design-system rollout, new homepage structure, and Document Processing.

### D. Document Processing protected-page media/story slice

Purpose: focus only on the protected Document Processing project package.

Includes:

- Reviewing the four temporary placeholder images.
- Caption tone.
- Whether a safer diagram/composite is needed.
- Later Claude/Figma audit when screens are ready.

Excludes homepage promotion, sitemap changes, `noindex` changes, password-gate changes, and broad case-study rewrites unless Victor explicitly chooses them.

### E. Future concepts parked

Purpose: keep bigger ideas captured without letting them accidentally become the next implementation task.

Includes:

- A2UI.
- Broader visual expansion.
- New portfolio concept systems.
- Report-style chapter treatments.
- Bigger motion/prototype ideas.

Status: paused unless Victor explicitly selects one.

- `implementation-ready` — enough detail for Claude Code/site work
- `implemented-local` — page exists locally, not approved live
- `live` — published on site
- `paused` — intentionally not moving

## Project tracker

| Project | Status | Visibility | Source docs | Next action | Blockers / cautions |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Document Processing | live | live, password-protected for visitors, noindex, currently linked from the Work dropdown, omitted from sitemap | `document-processing.html`; package manifest in `case-studies/document-processing.md`; placeholder media merged in PR #63; private audit handoff at `C:\Users\Victor\Documents\Website Items\Portfolio Handoffs\Document Processing\document-processing-claude-code-figma-media-audit-consolidated-2026-06-02.md` | Keep live in its current protected state; review placeholder-media fit later if Victor selects the package | Preserve password gate/noindex and current navigation visibility; do not add homepage/sitemap links, raw screenshot dumps, metrics, launch claims, or major copy/media changes without approval |
| IBM Cloud Observability | live | public/password status follows existing site | existing HTML/content | No active action | Treat existing page as source of truth |
| IBM Patterns | live | protected | existing HTML/content | No active action | Preserve password gate |

| Pi Kapp App | live | public | existing HTML/content | No active action | None noted |
| Ability Experience | live | public | existing HTML/content | No active action | None noted |
| SAL Magazine | live | public | existing HTML/content | No active action | None noted |
| Art & Illustration / Graphics galleries | live | public, discoverable under Work and in the homepage Galleries subsection | `artillustration.html`; `graphicgallery.html`; homepage Work section | Review placement after nav simplification | Large image performance worth watching |

## Site health

Primary automation: `.github/workflows/health-check.yml`

Current state from latest local audit:

- GitHub health workflow is active.
- Local health script exists at `scripts/health-check.sh`.
- Local preflight currently runs the link check successfully from this PC/WSL setup.
- Local Lighthouse remains remote/GitHub-only.
- Current local image scan found no images over 1MB, though several were close in the historical `archive/planning/portfolio-upkeep-backlog-2026-05-17.md` snapshot.
- Historical note: PR #21 failed because `/document-processing` canonical/live link 404ed before the page existed live. Current state is intentional: `/document-processing` is live on Vercel, password-gated, noindex, and omitted from the sitemap.

## Preferred workflow

1. Treat each project as a package: source HTML, generated content export, package manifest, assets, and archived source notes.
2. Put durable project-package context in a single manifest under `case-studies/<slug>.md`.
3. Keep visibility, facts, narrative direction, media guidance, redesign notes, and agent boundaries in that one file unless the project truly gets huge.
4. Before touching HTML, confirm visibility/confidentiality status.
5. After meaningful site changes, run the local sanity check:
   - `./scripts/preflight.sh`
6. Before push/PR, inspect changed files with `git diff --stat` and ask Vic before external-facing/significant changes.
7. Use the GitHub health workflow for full remote Lighthouse/link checks.

## Next system improvements

- Keep the About page `Training for: (WIP)` line as an intentional joke.
- Treat Document Processing as live. Its password gate is the visitor-privacy layer, and that state is acceptable. If Vic selects that package later, use the consolidated Claude Code + Figma media audit handoff in `C:\Users\Victor\Documents\Website Items\Portfolio Handoffs\Document Processing\document-processing-claude-code-figma-media-audit-consolidated-2026-06-02.md` as source material before changing visuals or claims.
- Windows Git and Windows GitHub CLI are available as WSL credential bridges for push/PR/merge work when plain WSL Git/GH auth is unavailable.
- Consider local Lychee or a Windows-native health script only if local link checks become routine outside preflight.
- Optional later: add a weekly GitHub health digest only if failures occur.
